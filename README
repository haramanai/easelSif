easelSif for HTML5 it's a lib to play an unzipped sif file on the html canvas.
Sif are the files that produced by the open source vector animation software : Synfig www.synfig.org

It uses the createjs.EaselJS for rendering and interaction.
TweenJS (MIT license) for the tweens. www.createjs.com

It's published under the MIT license.

It is a conversion of sifPlayer to run inside easeljs.
Future development will be on easelSif and not sifPlayer.

The object that is produced is a Container object of easeljs all the layers are easeljs objects.

It is not complete future. 
It supports the types of layers:
	Region  (Shape)
	Outline (without point width) (Shape)
	Circle  (Shape)
	Import (image)
	Group layer (Container)
	Scale  (Container)
	Translate  (Container)
	Rotate  (Container)
	Zoom	(Container)
	Stretch  (Container)
	Timeloop  (Container)

The blend methods that much the globalCompositeOperation of the context2d

	Composite		=>  source-over
	Straight		=>  copy
	Onto			=>  source-atop //With a bug that will render onto everything in the layer list.
	Straight Onto	=>  source-in
	Behind			=>  destination-over
	Alpha Over		=>  destination-out
	Alpha Brighter	=>  destination-in

The convert that you can use.

Vector converts to:
	radial composite
	composite
	add
	subtract
	scale

Real converts to:
	add
	subtract
	scale
	cos
	sine
	expotential
	dotproduct
	logarithm
	reciprocal

Angle converts to:
	add
	subtract
	scale
	atan2
	cos
	dotproduct (remember that this is using two Math.sqrt)
	vectorAngle

Integer converts to:
	add
	subtract
	scale

Bool converts to:
	and






Run the easelSif.html to see it. 

There is a min version in the build folder

Also in the /assets/ are sifparser.html  you can run it to have an understanding of how the data looks like. But keep in mind that the defs will change in the init of the SifObject to be accessed by the id of the defs.

		How to use it :

	
var def = {width: 320, height: 240, sifPath: 'assets/'};
var sifobj = easelSif.SifObject( xmlDoc, def);

As you can see the first param is an XML Document object.
The def param is an javascript object everything that you may wand to add to the SifObject like the x position that will be the upper left corner of the SifObject in the context
the width that you wand the SifObject to have
And the necessary sifPath that you will need if you use imagies. With sifPath SifObject will know where to search for the imagies that your sif animation used.


sifobj.tick(delta) //moves the sifobject's timeline 'delta' milliseconds.

sifobj.setPosition( pos ) // set the position of sifobject's timeline to the 'pos' millisecs.




The desc.
The sifObject contains a propertie name desc. Desc is a reference of all the layers by name.
For example if you wand to grap the layer : circle
sifobj.desc['circle']

Also if you wand your animation to loop you can tell the timeline loop
sifobj.timeline.loop = true;

For more information about the timeline see the createjs tweenjs documentations.
---------------------------------------

Don't forget that .sif files are xml files.
